The goal of this invitation-only event is to identify joint projects to pursue in the coming year, and to build the CUAC community.  We will be emphasizing existing projects with their own inertia that can benefit from CUAC engagement (analytics support, gap funding, cross-border connections).

Format: Discussion-oriented workshop of about 20 people: 6 UBC faculty, 6-8 UW faculty, and several other attendees.

Themes: 1. Equitable mobility and transportation; 2. Housing stability; 3. Responsible data management.

Location: The Husky Union Building (HUB) at the University of Washington: Room 214.

> The Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative is an applied, interdisciplinary, regional center that brings together academic researchers, students, and public stakeholder groups to address topics affecting citizens of the Cascadia region.

#### Schedule:

* 1:00pm - Overview: What CUAC is about, goals, what we're looking for, what the "ideal" projects look like - Bill Howe, Director, UW Urbanalytics.
* 1:10pm - Introductions around the table, 2-3 minutes about your research and what you'd like to get out of this meeting.  Your answers to the prompts will be available as a handout to others.
* 1:40pm - What can CUAC do for you? Raymond Ng, Scientific Director of the Data Science Institute at UBC and Bill Howe.
	* Possible funding opportunities
	* Connections (collaborators working in specific areas, especially across the border)
	* Analytics (you provide questions + large, noisy, heterogeneous data, we provide answers)
* 2:10pm - Break
* 2:30pm - Breakout prep: Identify existing projects that can benefit from CUAC.  As a group, we’ll write down existing projects to invest time and energy into, then break into groups to explore the details over the next year.
* 3:00pm - Breakouts
* 4:00pm - Break
* 4:15pm - Report back
* 4:45pm - Wrap up and next steps
* 5:00pm - Break, travel to dinner
* 6:00pm - Dinner, location TBA

Discussion about “The Promise of Uniform Urban Metrics”

In 2014, the International Standards Organization (ISO) approved ISO 37120, the first standard for urban sustainability and performance. The ISO project originated in the World Bank and is now administered by the World Council on City Data (WCCD)(http://dataforcities.org) , part of the University of Toronto’s Global Cities Institute. There are about 50 cities currently enrolled in the WCCD, with another 50 applications under review.

On Tuesday morning, CUAC-related faculty and students from UW and UBC are invited to participate in a discussion of the research and operational opportunities associated with the emergence of ISO 37120. Joining us will be representatives of the cities of Seattle, Portland, Surrey, and Vancouver (Seattle, Portland, and Surrey are already members of the WCCD; Vancouver is currently considering joining). In addition, representatives of Microsoft, software and consulting firm iSoftStone, and Western Washington University will attend. We will be joined by phone by the leadership of the WCCD.

Tentative agenda:
* 8:00-8:45: Coffee (and look at CUAC student posters)
* 8:45-9:00: Introductions
* 9:00-9:45: Discussion with Patricia McCarney (WCCD President) about ISO 37120: What’s measured? How can the data be used? How does ISO 37120 compare with
other urban metrics? What are the advantages for cities being part of WCCD, both
now and in the future? What is the possibility of national-level endorsement of
WCCD leading to the addition of all cities from several countries? What are the big
data implications of automated urban data collection? How can WCCD be used for
Data Science for Social Good projects? Discussion of forthcoming ISO standards for
Smart Cities (ISO 37122) and Resilient Cities (ISO 37123); how do these differ from
ISO 37120? What are the opportunities for piloting these new sets of metrics in
Cascadia? Can ISO standards be applied to larger jurisdictions, including entire
Metros (e.g., Toronto) and entire regions (e.g., Cascadia Corridor)? What would be
required for university campuses be ISO certified as small “test-bed cities”?
* 9:45-10:15: Urban analytic and sustainability research opportunities presented by WCCD data
for collaborations among universities and cities in a variety of domains (e.g.,
transportation, housing, healthcare). Can urban modeling incorporate WCCD data?
* 10:15-10:45: Private sector (startups; established tech companies) opportunities for urban
analytic software and “smart city” sensor network development using WCCD data
* 10:45-11:00: Next steps
* 11:00 Break (Attendees for Microsoft event head to downtown Seattle)
* 11:15-noon: Discussion among city representatives and remaining CUAC faculty and students
and WCCD staff about operational challenges and opportunities associated with
ISO data collection and potential role of universities in facilitating the process

*To be ISO certified, a city must measure up to 100 agreed-upon urban parameters in standard
ways. Once independently verified by outside consulting firms, these data sets allow the first
“apples-to- apples” comparisons of 17 urban topics across cities around the world. Like with
LEED, cities are ranked as Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze based on the number of metrics (out of
100) they agree to measure, not the values of those metrics. The goal is data sharing and
transparency, to help cities achieve operational and sustainability goals more quickly.
