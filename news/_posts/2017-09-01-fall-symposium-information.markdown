The goal of this invitation-only event is to identify joint projects to pursue in the coming year, and to build the CUAC community.  We will be emphasizing existing projects with their own inertia that can benefit from CUAC engagement (analytics support, gap funding, cross-border connections).

Format: Discussion-oriented workshop of about 20 people: 6 UBC faculty, 6-8 UW faculty, and several other attendees.

Themes: 1. Equitable mobility and transportation; 2. Housing stability; 3. Responsible data management.

Location: The Husky Union Building (HUB) at the University of Washington: Room 214.

> The Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative is an applied, interdisciplinary, regional center that brings together academic researchers, students, and public stakeholder groups to address topics affecting citizens of the Cascadia region.

#### Schedule:

* 1:00pm - Overview: What CUAC is about, goals, what we're looking for, what the "ideal" projects look like - Bill Howe, Director, UW Urbanalytics.
* 1:10pm - Introductions around the table, 2-3 minutes about your research and what you'd like to get out of this meeting.  Your answers to the prompts will be available as a handout to others.
* 1:40pm - What can CUAC do for you? Raymond Ng, Scientific Director of the Data Science Institute at UBC and Bill Howe.
	* Funding (~1 quarter of a PhD student)
	* Connections (collaborators working in specific areas, especially across the border)
	* Analytics (you provide questions + large, noisy, heterogeneous data, we provide answers)
* 2:10pm - Break
* 2:30pm - Breakout prep: Identify existing projects that can benefit from CUAC.  As a group, weâ€™ll write down existing projects to invest time and energy into, then break into groups to explore the details over the next year.
* 3:00pm - Breakouts
* 4:00pm - Break
* 4:15pm - Report back
* 4:45pm - Wrap up and next steps
